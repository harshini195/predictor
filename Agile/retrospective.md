# SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE – AI STUDENT PERFORMANCE PREDICTOR

## What Went Well
- Fast UI development using MUI.
- Backend + ML integration successful.
- Dashboard looks clean & informative.
- Faculty & student separation works smoothly.

## What Didn’t Go Well
- Initial ML file missing (label_encoder.pkl).
- Git conflicts during push.
- Dashboard not updating (state misplacement in App.js).

## Improvements for Next Sprint
- Move all predictor states to global context (Redux or Context API).
- Add database storage for predictions instead of localStorage.
- Add graphs for long-term student performance.
- Improve error handling for backend failures.
